# Getting Started with React Hooks

React Hooks revolutionized how we write React components. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

## Why Use Hooks?

Hooks solve several problems:

1. **Reusing stateful logic** between components
2. **Simplifying complex components** that were hard to understand
3. **Avoiding wrapper hell** in your component tree

## Basic Hooks

### useState

The `useState` hook lets you add state to functional components:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### useEffect

The `useEffect` hook lets you perform side effects:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }, [count]); // Only re-run if count changes

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Custom Hooks

You can create your own hooks to extract component logic into reusable functions.

## Conclusion

Start using hooks in your next project and experience the benefits firsthand!
