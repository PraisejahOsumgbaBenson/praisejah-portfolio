# Building Scalable APIs with Node.js

Building scalable APIs requires careful planning and architecture. Here are key principles:

## 1. RESTful Design

- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Use meaningful resource names
- Version your API

## 2. Error Handling

- Consistent error responses
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages for debugging

## 3. Performance Optimization

- Implement caching
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Database query optimization

## 4. Security

- Authentication & Authorization
- Input validation
- Rate limiting

## 5. Monitoring & Logging

- Request logging
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking

## Conclusion

Building scalable APIs is both an art and a science. Start implementing these principles today.
